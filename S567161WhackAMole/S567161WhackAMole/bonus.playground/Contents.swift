      Model: The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the data and defines how it should be manipulated and accessed. In iOS development, models are typically represented by classes or structs. Examples of models include user data, application settings, or any other data required by the application.
      View: The View is responsible for presenting the user interface elements to the user. It displays the data from the Model and communicates user interactions back to the Controller. In iOS development, views are often implemented using UIKit components such as UILabel, UIButton, UITableView, etc. Views should be as dumb as possible, meaning they should not contain any business logic and should only focus on presenting the data provided by the Controller.
      Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, manipulates the Model based on that input, and updates the View accordingly. In iOS development, controllers are typically implemented as subclasses of UIViewController or NSObject. Controllers handle user interactions, perform validation, and orchestrate the flow of data between the Model and the View
      
      The purpose of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern in iOS app development is to:
      
      Separate concerns by dividing the application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.
      Model: Handles data and business logic.
      View: Presents the user interface elements.
      Controller: Orchestrates communication between Model and View, handling user input and updating the View accordingly.
      Promotes code organization, reusability, maintainability, and testability.

            Optionals in Swift help handle situations where a value may be nil by allowing variables or constants to either contain a value of a certain type or be nil. They provide a safe way to work with potentially absent values, avoiding runtime errors like null pointer exceptions.

           Common techniques for safely unwrapping optionals to access their underlying values include:

        1.Optional Binding: Using if let or guard let to conditionally unwrap an optional and bind the unwrapped value to a new constant or variable within a certain scope.
        2.Optional Chaining: Using the ? operator to access properties, methods, and subscripts of an optional that might be nil. If the optional contains a value, the property, method, or subscript call succeeds; otherwise, it returns nil.
        3.Nil Coalescing Operator (??): Providing a default value to use when an optional is nil.
        4.Force Unwrapping: Using the ! operator to forcefully unwrap an optional. This should be used cautiously, as it may cause a runtime error if the optional is nil.
        5.Optional Binding with Multiple Values: Using multiple optional bindings in a single if let statement to unwrap multiple optionals simultaneously.
        6.Optional Map: Applying a transformation to the value inside an optional if it's not nil, otherwise returning nil.

        1.Accessing Data: Data stored in user defaults is accessed using the UserDefaults class provided by iOS SDK. Values are retrieved using methods like string(forKey:), integer(forKey:), bool(forKey:), etc., corresponding to the data types being stored.
       2.Setting Data: Data is set or updated in user defaults using the set(_:forKey:) method or its variants. After setting the data, it's important to synchronize the user defaults to ensure changes are saved persistently. This is done by calling synchronize() or letting the system automatically synchronize at appropriate times.
       3.Managing Data: Throughout the application lifecycle, data stored in user defaults can be managed by retrieving, updating, or removing values as needed. It's crucial to handle situations where the data might not exist or be in an unexpected format to avoid runtime errors.
      4.Persisting Data: Data stored in user defaults persists between app launches, making it suitable for storing user preferences or small amounts of data that need to be retained even if the app is closed and reopened.
      5.Considerations: While user defaults are convenient for storing simple data types, they are not suitable for storing large amounts of data or sensitive information. For such cases, other storage options like Core Data, SQLite

            Here's a brief explanation of the concept of timers and their typical usage:

            Types of Timers:
        1.Dispatch Timers: Utilize Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to schedule tasks on a concurrent queue.
            a.NSTimer (Foundation Timer): Legacy timer class provided by the Foundation framework.
            b.Timer (DispatchSourceTimer): Introduced in iOS 10, uses dispatch sources for more precise timing and better performance.
            Usage:
            c.Executing Code After a Delay: Timers can be used to execute code blocks or methods after a specified delay.
            d.Repeated Execution: They can also be used to repeatedly execute code at regular intervals.
            e.UI Updates: Timers are commonly used for updating the user interface components such as labels, progress bars, or animations.
            f.Network Requests: Timers can trigger periodic network requests to update application data from remote sources.
            g.Game Development: In games, timers can be used for controlling animations, game mechanics, or AI behaviors.
            h.Controlling the Flow of Actions:
            Timers help in orchestrating the flow of actions within an application by scheduling tasks to occur at specific times or intervals.
            They enable developers to perform background tasks asynchronously without blocking the main thread, ensuring smooth user experience and responsiveness.
